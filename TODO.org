- [ ] Tests for api
- [ ] Log stdout, errors and results from lua somewhere
- [ ] Downloading/download path config
- [ ] Run JS in page
- [ ] INVESTIGATE: Segfault on close
- [ ] INVESTIGATE: Errors in keymap segfaults

** Next
- [ ] Search text in page
- [ ] Dev tools
- [ ] Fullscreen
- [ ] Zoom in/out
- [ ] Permission requests handling/persisting
- [ ] window.opener controls (use createWindow api directly?)
- [ ] Notifications
- [ ] Conflict in keymap (keymap already exists)
- [ ] Allow pattern filtering for event listeners
- [ ] Allow tab_id, win_id filtering for event listeners
- [ ] Handle resource cleanup + signal disconnecting
- [ ] Open url sanitize/humanize (add protocol if missing, remove quotes, etc)
- [ ] static linking for qt
- [X] static linking for libluv
- [ ] User scripts (greasemonkey?)
- [ ] User stylesheets (per site and global?)
- [ ] Bookmarking

** Later
- [ ] Support multiple modes for keymap.set: `web.keymap.set({'n','i'}, ...)`
- [ ] Read page contents via lua
- [ ] `web.to_string`: like vim.inspect
- [X] Update window title on current webview title change

** Later later
- [ ] Custom file picker
- [ ] remote debugging with cdp (spider-repl)

** Maybe
- [ ] Floating webviews?
- [ ] Move modal keymap management into lua?

** Notes
- view = 0, nil, none: Current view
- Win = 0: Current window
- Win = nil, none: All windows or current window based on operation
- Keep track of last focused window (current window is last focused)
